## 🎮 How to Play
1. The program randomly selects a word.
2. You must guess the word letter by letter.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position.
4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the hangman starts to form.
5. The game continues until:
   - ✅ You guess the word correctly (Win!).
   - ❌ You exceed the allowed incorrect guesses (Game Over!).
